- This magical program compresses files. -

If you want to compress a file, put it in the "In.txt" file, and run "run.bat"
You'll get a funky-looking compressed version in "Out.txt"

If you want to decompress a file, run "decomp.bat"
You'll get the original file back, minus the new-lines because I didn't make them happen yet.

If you don't like only using In.txt and Out.txt, you can edit the batch files to use different filenames. Just make sure the batch file to decompress has the "decompress" argument after both file names.
